| finance_manager         | 1. The entities and their attributes are choosen wisely. 2. The degree and cardinality seems to be appropriate. 3. No redundant relationships.                                                                     | 1. I am not sure of the fact that stock is a part of transaction and not directly related to tb_user. 2. Liability could have more attributes in order to be defined properly.                                                                                             | The draft meets the requirements                                                                                                                                        | I could not find the problem statement.

What is its relationship with assets and liabilities (unclear from ER Diagram but was mentioned in the outline)? Also, what is the unique ID for the balance? (referring to "The total balance too can change multiple times within a day and thus must be identified by a unique ID, rather than a date") What if the same user makes multiple transactions on the same date?   Overall, great job though! |
| finance_manager         | 1.Have all names. 2 have clear column. 3have good relationship description between different entities                                                                                                              | 1. miss type of variables in entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | It satisfies all requirements so far.                                                                                                                                   | Do we have to use tb_user as part of our project, or we do not really use it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| finance_manager         | 1.have enough entity to make the ERD has detailed information; 2.clear draw strategy which makes the most "busy" entity(tb_user) in the middle; 3.show the relations between entities specific and easy understand | Basically, I think the diagram is good. But, it may add more relations to form entity to entity, not only tb_user to others; It will be more clear if add type to attribution; Use a different name for different attribution ( like user_id in transaction and portfolio) | I think it satisfy the requirement, it show the outline detailed, and have the EDR and code is also cover.                                                              | I should add more entities in my EDR and make my work more clear and detailed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
