1. Changes made to `InitializeDao.java`.
2. Changed database from `bookstore` to `finance_manager`. Database `finance_manager` already created separately through MySQL command line, so only change needed is to connect to this new database instead of the previously used `bookstore`database from demo.
3. a. The tables for this new database are created and populated in `/src/WebContent/sql/initialize_db.sql`. Script runner. Its dependencies.
